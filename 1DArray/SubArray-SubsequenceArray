
Array - 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 10


Subarray - Continous part of array ---- 2 5 6 7 --- 1 2 5 ---- 7 8 9--- and so on remmeber Continous part of array.
No. of Subarray = nC2 + n;


Subsequence ---- Sequence  derived from array made by selecting elements form array without diturbing original order of remianing elements.
No. of Subsequence = 2**n;
example --  
			1   5 6     9   ---- remianing elements in original order
			  2     7 8   10 --- Subsequence


"Every Subarray is Subsequence but Every Subsequence is not Subarray"
